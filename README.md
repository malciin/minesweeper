<img src="https://drive.google.com/uc?export=view&id=0B84Fb42SRsObbzJYRWFBSlJlOGs" />

## Info
* Using SFML v2.4.2
* Modifiable interface (user can cofig square size, margin between squares, color and font)
* Double click support
* All square textures are rendered at runtime thus performance is fair due to use <b>sf::VertexArray</b> (even with 500^2 tiles)
* No recursion when reveal many empty tiles (stack overflow impossible on huge maps)

Project is still incomplete. All todos can be found <a href="https://github.com/malciin/minesweeper/projects/3">here</a>.
